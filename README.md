# project_mpu6050

An experimental project dealing with MPU6050 data processing

## Have done:
1. Read from MPU6050 with I2C
2. Real-time plot data with matplot++
3. Use chrono for timing

## To be done:
1. Apply complementary filter
2. Apply EKF filter
3. Sensor fusion between accelerometer and gyroscope
4. 3D visualize attitude using MPU6050 data
